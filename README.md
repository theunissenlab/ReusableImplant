# Chronic Reusable Implant Parts List and Instructions

Both .stl and .sldprt files have been included for your convinence. All SLDPRT files were made on SOLIDWORKS 2022.

## Implant Parts List

In this repository are all the parts required to build the chronic implant. It is made for use with the Cambridge Neurotech Mini-Amp and silicon probes. All parts were printed on FormLabs Form 3+. Specific printing instructions including resin type, density, and touchpoint size are detailed depending on the part.

### Docking

This is the module that is cemented to the skull after being screwed to the payload module. A new docking module is required for each implantation. Print in Rigid resin with density at 80 and touchpoint size at 0.4mm.

### Assembly Jig Parts List

In this section are all the parts needed to create the jig for assembly.

## Payload Holder

This is a holder that can is inserted into the payload module during assembly so that the payload module is centered. Print in Black resin with density 80 and touchpoint size at 0.45mm.
