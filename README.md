# Chronic Reusable Implant Parts List and Instructions

## Implant Parts List

In this repository are all the parts required to build the chronic implant. It is made for use with [insert type of amplifier, probe, etc]. All parts were printed on FormLabs Form 3+. Specific printing instructions including resin type, density, and touchpoint size are detailed depending on the part.

### Payload

This is the module that holds the probe. It is re-used across implantations. Print in Rigid resin with density at 80 and touchpoint size at 0.4mm.

### Docking

This is the module that is cemented to the skull after being screwed to the payload module. A new docking module is required for each implantation. Print in Rigid resin with density at 80 and touchpoint size at 0.4mm.

### Amplifier Holder

This is the module that inserts into the payload in order to hold and stablilize the amplifier. It is re-used across implantations. Print in Rigid resin with density at 80 and touchpoint size at 0.4mm.

### Headstage Cover

This is the cover for the implant. It protects the flex cable between the probe and amplifier. It is re-used across implantations. Print in Black resin with density 90 and touchpoint size at 0.4mm.

### Assembly Jib Parts List

In this section are all the parts needed to create the jig for assembly.

## Payload Holder

This is a holder that can is inserted into the payload module during assembly so that the payload module is centered. Print in Black resin with density 80 and touchpoint size at 0.45mm.

### Docking Holder

This is a holder that holds the docking module in place when using the jig to combine the two modules. Print in Black resin with density 80 and touchpoint size at 0.45mm.
